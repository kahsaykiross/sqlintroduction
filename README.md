Why SQL is Important in Web Applications

SQL is essential in most web apps because:

Websites and apps store user data, posts, products, etc., in databases

SQL is used to fetch and manipulate this data

 When users log in, post comments, view products, or make purchases, SQL is at work behind the scenes



 Building Blocks of Databases

1. Tables – Like spreadsheets; store data in rows and columns
Example: Users, Orders, Products


2. Columns – Define what type of data each field holds
Example: username, email, created_at


3. Data Types – Define the kind of data that can be stored in a column
Common examples:

INT (Integer)

VARCHAR(100) (Variable-length text)

DATE

BOOLEAN
 Example Table: Users

id (INT)	name (VARCHAR)	email (VARCHAR)	created_at (DATE)
1	Amina	amina@email.com	2025-08-01
2	David	david@email.com	2025-08-01
